## Compute Service Categories

AWS compute services span multiple paradigms, each optimized for different workload characteristics and operational models.

### Traditional Virtual Machines
**EC2** provides resizable compute capacity with full control over the underlying infrastructure, supporting diverse instance types optimized for different workloads.

### Serverless Computing
**Lambda** executes code in response to events without server provisioning, automatically scaling and charging only for actual compute time consumed.

### Container Orchestration
**ECS, EKS, and Fargate** provide managed container platforms supporting Docker and Kubernetes ecosystems with varying levels of infrastructure abstraction.

### Specialized Compute
**Batch, Lightsail, and Outposts** address specific use cases like high-performance computing, simplified deployments, and hybrid cloud scenarios.

## Amazon EC2

Elastic Compute Cloud forms the foundation of AWS compute, offering virtual servers with comprehensive customization capabilities.

### Instance Types and Families

AWS organizes EC2 instances into families optimized for specific workload patterns.

### Instance Purchasing Options

**On-Demand Instances**
```

- Ideal for: Development, testing, unpredictable workloads
```

**Reserved Instances**
```
Commitment Levels:
- 1-year terms: 20-40% savings
- 3-year terms: 40-60% savings

Payment Options:
- No Upfront: Lower discount, pay monthly
- Partial Upfront: Moderate discount, split payment

```

**Spot Instances**
```
Market-Based Pricing:

```

### EC2 Networking

**Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)**
- Virtual network cards attachable to instances
- Support multiple private IPs and security groups
- Enable network redundancy and hot-swapping

**Enhanced Networking**
- Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)
- Higher bandwidth and lower latency
- Required for cluster compute instances

**Placement Groups**
- **Cluster**: Low latency within single AZ
- **Partition**: Spread across hardware partitions
- **Spread**: Each instance on separate hardware

### Storage Options

**Instance Store**
```
Characteristics:
- Temporary storage physically attached to host
- High IOPS and throughput
- Data lost on instance stop/termination
- Included in instance pricing
```

**Amazon EBS**
```

- io2: Provisioned IOPS SSD for mission-critical
- st1: Throughput optimized HDD for big data
- sc1: Cold HDD for infrequent access
```

## AWS Lambda

Serverless computing service enabling event-driven code execution without infrastructure management.

### Core Concepts

**Function as Unit of Deployment**
- Single-purpose code packages with dependencies
- Runtime environment selection (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
- Memory allocation determines CPU and networking performance

**Event-Driven Execution**
- Synchronous invocation with immediate response
- Asynchronous invocation with automatic retry
- Stream-based invocation for real-time processing

**Automatic Scaling**
```
Scaling Behavior:
- Concurrent executions scale automatically
- Default limit: 1000 concurrent executions
- Cold start latency for new execution environments
- Warm execution contexts reused when possible
```

### Lambda Programming Model

**Handler Function**
```python
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Process the event
    result = process_data(event['data'])
    
    # Return response
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps(result)
    }
```

**Context Object**
```python
# Available context properties
context.function_name        # Function name
context.function_version     # Function version
context.memory_limit_in_mb   # Memory allocation
context.remaining_time_in_millis  # Execution time remaining
```

### Performance Optimization

**Memory Configuration**
- Memory range: 128MB to 10,240MB (10GB)
- CPU allocation scales proportionally with memory
- Network bandwidth increases with memory allocation

**Cold Start Mitigation**
```
Strategies:
- Provisioned Concurrency for predictable latency
- Connection pooling and global variable reuse
- Minimize deployment package size
- Use runtime-specific optimization techniques
```

**Execution Environment Lifecycle**
```
Phases:
1. Init: Download code and initialize runtime
2. Invoke: Execute handler function
3. Shutdown: Clean up execution environment

Optimization:
- Initialize expensive resources outside handler
- Reuse connections and clients across invocations
- Cache configuration and authentication tokens
```

## Container Services

AWS provides multiple container orchestration options supporting different operational models and Kubernetes compatibility.
